## Key Features  
  
- **Efficient Contract Review:** Streamline the process of contract review with AI-driven summarization and analysis.  
- **Policy and Compliance Checks:** Ensure compliance with company policies through integrated policy checks.  
- **Customizable Solution:** Modify and extend functionalities with access to the open-source code.

## Architecture  
  
The plugin's architecture consists of a front-end UI, developed in JavaScript, integrated directly into Microsoft Word as an Office 365 plugin. The back end employs Azure PromptFlow, which acts as an orchestration engine triggered by plugin commands. PromptFlow operates in AKS with Docker or in Azure AI Studio, utilizing two Azure AI Search indexes—one for document data and another for company policy. The runtime for PromptFlow is Python, enabling Azure OpenAI LLM calls for summarization and compliance checks. The solution's configuration, including API keys, is stored within the plugin and can be modified via the configuration tab.

## Prerequisites  
  
To install and run the plugin locLegalEdge, ensure you have the following:  
  
- Office 365  
- Node.js and NPM  
- Python  
- Visual Studio Code  
- PromptFlow libraries  
- Azure OpenAI with GPT-4o model and Ada-002 for embedding  
- Azure AI Search (Basic tier)  
- Azure AI Studio for PromptFlow or AKS for Docker usage  

> [!NOTE]  
> Use Azure OpenAi GPT4o with the `2024-08-06` model version

## Installation
  
**Local Installation:**  
  
1. Ensure all prerequisites are installed.  
2. Clone the repository to your local machine. 
3. Navigate to the solution directory.  
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  
5. Start the plugin with `npm start`.  

>[!NOTE]
> Next Steps are for the backend server (PromptFlow), there are 2 options, runing local PF or runing Docker file, the Docker is recomanded for fast Demo, the local is recomanded for development and debug

6. Go to the PrompFlow  folder
7. If NOT using Docker with PromptFlow you will need to create 1 local connector in PF
this can be done using PF Extention, please install PromptFlow Extention for VS Code,

![Extention](./files/Screenshot%202025-01-05%20133207.png)

> [!NOTE]
> please do install all PF prereqesist listed under the extention.

8. create a connector under the connectrs tub with the name "LegalEdge"

![Connector](./files/Screenshot%202025-01-05%20133650.png)

in the opened screen fill in the next information:

```
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/promptflow/latest/CustomConnection.schema.json
name: "LegalEdge"
type: custom
configs:
  openai_endpoint: "https://xxxxxxxxxx.openai.azure.com/"
  search_document_index: "legal-documents"
  search_policy_index: "legal-instructions"
  openai_model_deployment: "gpt4o"
  openai_embedding_deployment: "ada002"
  openai_api_version: "2024-08-01-preview"
  search_endpoint: "https://xxxxxxxx.search.windows.net"
secrets:
  openai_key: "<user-input>"
  search_key: "<user-input>"
```
> [!NOTE]
> remove all unneeded key/paramiters like key1 if its shows in the created schema before you save

> [!NOTE]
> the name "LegalEdge" is used in the ymal file so if you choose to use a connector with diffrent name, do change it in the PF yaml

8. Run `pf flow serve --source . --port 8083 --host localhost`
9. This will load a local web on port `8083` and can be used by the Plugin
10. ***/cofig/cofig.json*** file need to hold the endpoint of the PromptFlow endpoint under the `prompt-flow-endpoint`
    for exmaple `"prompt-flow-endpoint" : "http://localhost:8083/score"` for local run of PF


**Office 365 Deployment:**  
  
- under Development there is no need to do any changes under Office, as this repo will create and aloocate the plugin localy on this muchine
- in production there are steps to create an Add on in the Addon list and provide the URL for the location of the deployment under Azure WebApp

## Azure Services Configuration  
  
### Azure Search
- for the solution to work where will need to be Azure Search 2 Indexes:
    - `legal-instructions`
        This Index is holding add customer Policy Chunks with the next table fields:

        | Field Name | Type | Description | 
        | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
        | id | Int32 | Key
        | title | String | Policy Title
        | instruction | String | Policy instructions
        | embeding | SingleCollection | Embedding of the policy instruction 
        | tags | StringCollection | tags
        | locked | Boolean | is changeble
        | groups | StringCollection | list of Active Directory ID's that are related to this policy
        | severity | Int32 | 2 - Warning, 1 - Critical


    - `legal-documents`
        This Index is holding all the chunks of the Documents provided for the plugin review:
        | Field Name | Type | Description |
        | ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
        | id | Int32 | Key
        | title | String | 
        | paragraph | String |
        | keyphrases | StringCollection | Generated by Skill and LLM

1. Go to docker folder in the project
2. Run `docker build -t {Give you name for the container} .`
3. Run the container with port `8083` and the next paramiters:

- configs:
  - "LegalEdge_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://xxxxxx.openai.azure.com/",
  - "LegalEdge_SEARCH_DOCUMENT_INDEX=legal-documents",
  - "LegalEdge_SEARCH_POLICY_INDEX=legal-instructions",
  - "LegalEdge_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT=gpt4o",
  - "LegalEdge_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=ada002",
